# TextSummarization_Pegasus
This project is implementation of the Deep Learning Pegasus Model for the text summarization system.
This text summarization is predominantly for the "abstractive textsummarization".
Dataset and model is taken from the hugging face opensources library.
Pegasus is the SOTA and proposed in the 2020 research paper of "Pegasus:Pretarining Encoder model"
And in this process we used the finetuned version of the pegasus model whic is on the "CNN_Daily Mail " Dataset
